# Assignment 1 - Express.js and Nodemon

## In this assignment I will:

### 1. **Create an npm project with Express.js and nodemon**

### 2. **Create an Express.js app that funnels a response through 2 middleware functions. Each function will log a text to the console. A response is eventually returned.**

### 3. **In the same app, handle two requests to the "/" and "/users" routes. Each route has its own function and will return some text as a response**
